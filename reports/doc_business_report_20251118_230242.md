## 📋 Document Summary

The SmartExcel project aims to develop a web application that enables users to upload Excel files, train an AI model on the data, and perform natural language queries. The application will provide intuitive, secure, scalable, and accessible services for a broad user base. The key objectives of the project include enabling users to extract actionable insights from Excel data using natural language, supporting both technical and non-technical queries, providing answers as both text and dynamic visualizations, allowing seamless ingestion of new Excel data, and delivering a user-friendly web application suitable for business and non-technical users.

The background and rationale behind the project are rooted in the common problem faced by many organizations that store critical data in multiple Excel files but lack tools to analyze or query this data easily. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize access to data analysis, enabling users to ask questions in plain language and receive immediate, insightful answers with visualizations.

The scope of the project includes:

1. Upload, parse, and store Excel files.
2. Train an LLM on user-uploaded data.
3. Natural Language Query interface for text and visualization answers.
4. Comparative, ranking, and trend analysis capabilities.
5. Multi-user support with secure authentication.
6. Visualization generation (charts, graphs, tables).
7. Continuous data ingestion and training/adaptation.

The stakeholders involved in the project include end-users (business analysts, managers, non-technical staff), product owner/project sponsor, software development team, datascience/AI specialists, IT security team, and other relevant teams.

The requirements for the project are divided into functional and non-functional requirements. The functional requirements include:

1. Users can upload Excel files (.xls, .xlsx).
2. System parses, indexes, and stores Excel data securely.
3. LLM is trained on uploaded data for contextual understanding.
4. Users can ask natural language queries about their data.
5. System answers queries with both text and relevant visualizations.
6. System supports technical (e.g., statistical analysis, correlations) and non-technical queries.
7. Users can compare, rank, and analyze trends across products/data points.
8. Users can upload new Excel files at any time; system updates knowledge base.
9. Multi-user support with secure authentication and role-based access.

The non-functional requirements include:

1. Response time for queries should be less than a certain threshold.
2. Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
3. Web interface must be intuitive and accessible.
4. System must scale to support 20 concurrent users.
5. System must comply with relevant data protection regulations.

The proposed process involves the following steps:

1. User logs into the web application.
2. User uploads one or more Excel files.
3. System parses and indexes data; LLM is adapted to new data.
4. User submits a natural language query.
5. System interprets the query, performs analysis, and returns a text answer and visualization.

The assumptions behind the project include:

1. Users have valid Excel files with structured data.
2. LLM can be efficiently adapted or prompted with new data without full retraining.
3. Visualization libraries can generate required charts/graphs from Excel data.

However, there are limitations to the initial version of the application, including support for only Excel files, accuracy dependence on data quality and structure, and lack of real-time collaboration support.

The project also identifies risks, including data privacy and security risks if sensitive data is uploaded, LLM may misinterpret ambiguous queries, and performance challenges with very large datasets or concurrent users.
